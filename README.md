This template is available in [Github-repository](https://github.com/JanoBourian/utils-creditkit). This template was born to accelerate the development of Google Cloud Functions through the most useful tasks how:
    - config different environments 
    - Models for the request and response
    - repository with each one of the requests of another or external services (like GCP Token or for retrieve information)
    - services with the different apps. Usually we need to work with only one file.
    - main.py as a entry point in our function
    - config.py with the configuration (in case of config folder won't necessary)
